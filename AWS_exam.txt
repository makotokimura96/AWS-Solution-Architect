- NAT gateways allow private instances to initiate outbound traffic to the Internet but do not allow inbound
traffic from the Internet to reach the private instances.
- The solutions architect should then create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC traffic to the NAT gateway in its AZ. This
will allow instances in the private subnets to access the Internet through the NAT gateways in the public subnets.
102.AB

deterministic, fast regional failover.

- Extend the application to add an attribute that has a value of the current timestamp plus 30 days to each new item that is created in the
table. Configure DynamoDB to use the attribute as the TTL attribute.
- The DynamoDB TTL feature allows you to define a per-item timestamp to determine when an item is no longer needed. Shortly after the
date and time of the specified timestamp, DynamoDB deletes the item from your table without consuming any write throughput.
